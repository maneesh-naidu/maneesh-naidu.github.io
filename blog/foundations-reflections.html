      <h1>Foundation Reflections</h1>

      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        I have learned that my ability to absorb information can be significantly varied based upon my mindset at the time. I am often hard on myself and I could really see this affecting my ability to just push forward with tasks at times. Whilst I have looked into mindfulness practices in the past, it was really nice to be able to integrate that into my working day and use it as a tool to help with self criticism. I have also learnt that I have a shorter focus span than I used to. I was involved in a car accident that left me with a fairly significant brain injury and understanding that I need to take regular short breaks for my own good has been beneficial. In terms of my ego, I try as best as possible to remain humble where I can. I celebrate the moments I do something well, but am acutely aware of the fact that there is always more to learn.
      </p>

      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
      <p>
        Values are something that I feel can be both a personal and professionally based view. For programming and myself personally, adhering to principles such as integrity and diligence can be seen in the way we have treated these excercises. It would be easy to copy code without really understanding what it meant, but that's not the type of person I would like to be! I believe that empathy is paramount to having a learning mentality, realising that others are also trying to learn and understand, and correspondingly, that the facilitators are in a position where they need to cater to multiple stages of learning with the students. Understanding how others are feeling during a project or course is always important when you will be working with peers. I have really had to focus more on being self aware during this induction, It has often felt difficult to focus when in pain and I have really had to be aware of when to take breaks and when I should step back from something that just isn't working, or a concept that just isn't sinking in. It doesn't help that I work best during the night!

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        I don't believe that I was surprised per se, I think the content was about what I expected having read some of the induction material prior to starting the course.
      </p>
      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>
        Writing about myself. I really don't find that this comes easily to me, it's something I will need to work on. I am a bit of an introvert, so speaking about myself is never easy.
      </p>
      <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
      <p>
        I don't find this difficult to understand. During my working career, I have seen similar practices being implemented into corporate culture and I am personally all for it.
      </p>
      <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
      <p>
        As above, no I do not think so. I believe that investment into our personal development is a valid part of overall growth, and there is always time when a break from technical learning is advantageous.
