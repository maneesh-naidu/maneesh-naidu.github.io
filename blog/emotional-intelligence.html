      <h1>Emotional Intelligence / EQ</h1>
      
      <p>
        This article is to document my thoughts and learnings on Emotional Intelligence(or EQ). We were tasked with researching what EQ meant to each of us, and my thoughts are as follows:
      </p>
      
      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      
      <p>
        We have all been exposed to the concept of IQ or intelligence throughout our education, personally my younger self, always believed that having a high IQ would result in success in life, without realising there were other factors that were just as or <strong>more</strong> important than just intelligence.
        This brings us to Emotional Intellignce, or EQ. I really enjoyed the following definition of EQ: <em>"Emotional intelligence is the capacity to blend thinking and feeling to make optimal decisions. It's being smarter with feelings.</em> a more standard definition from Wikipedia is: <em>Emotional intelligence is most often defined as the ability to perceive, use, understand, manage, and handle emotions.</em> The term "Emotional Intelligence" gained popularity from the 1995 publication of the same name from journalist Daniel Goleman.
      </p>
      <p>
        From my research, I found it interesting that there was always a tie to awareness when discussing EQ. I have long been quite self-critical of myself, however I think that energy can be diverted towards being more aware of how I am feeling, rather than giving into future uncertanties.
      </p>

      <h3>How is it different from IQ?</h3>
      <p>
        IQ was a term defined in the early 20th century and bascially refers to a total score from a set of tests designed to assess intelligence. It can be viewed as a measure of a person's intelligence, however, this is in no way a measure of a person's capability. EQ differs in that, whilst efforts have been made to measure it, I believe that it is the process of learning and understanding EQ that really brings benefit to individuals, not just getting a score.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following is a list (taken from Healthline.com) of some things you may find it easier to do if you have a high EQ:
          <ul>
            <li>Identify emotions in yourself and others</li>
            <li>Empathize with people</li>
            <li>Adapt your feelings and behaviour to different situations</li>
            <li>Control your impulses</li>
            <li>Withstand temptations and delay gratification</li>
            <li>Resolve conflict with others</li>
            <li>Communicate effectively</li>
          </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>

      <p>
        There has recently been strong research to show the importance of EQ and how it pertains to successful leadership, and how it can improve both our personal and professional lives. EQ has often been linked to both job success and more satisfying relationships. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From a personal standpoint, I found it interesting that EQ has been shown to assist in recovery from acute stress scenario's, something that I have had to deal with in the past. Also, I am aware that hiring managers will often place higher importance in a potential candidates EQ or ability to fit in within the company than their technical ability. These should all be reason enough to really invest in our own EQ development.
