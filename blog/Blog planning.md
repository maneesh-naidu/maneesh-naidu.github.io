Blog planning

Primary purpose - Document my progress towards becoming a developer.
Audience - peers, tutors, friends.
How do I build the site? - logically layed out - intuitive design flow.
Wireframe - please hold
Directories - Images / css / js (eventually) / media?
Styling on blog - should be uniform. (link to same css?)

Learning Plan

    What is your long term goal or career pathway?
      - I would like to look at junior developer roles as a natural outcome of successfully completing this bootcamp, with the intention of working towards a senior developer role within 3-5 years. In terms of goals, one of my key drivers is getting into a position where I am able to work remotely which would hopefully give me the balance needed to pursue my personal motorsport goals.

    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
      - I believe that my analytical nature will serve me well with regards to coding. I am good at looking at working examples and being able to assimilate that information. I am a natural problem solver, and try and be creative with solutions. 
      - In terms of limitations, I definitely need to put work into my time management. I also feel like I can be too critical of my work, and this can also be a time sink.

    What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      - I would like to use the group learning environment to develop my active listening skills, as well as work on my presentation skills in a technical capacity.

    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
      - My intention is to keep regular cadence with my study sessions with a focus on multiple shorter sessions with breaks, I have found this works well for me in terms of content retention.
      - My commitment to myself has been to invest no less than 40 hours per week into studies or coding practice
      - I will treat other students and facilitators and affiliates with respect and honesty, which I hope fosters the same in return.
      - When I run into issues, I will reach out to my homegroup facilitators and peers for help / support. I am also lucky to have the support of a friend who has been a great "rubber ducky" to date.
      - I will also be making a conscious effort to take a step away from my desk when I feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Taking even a few minutes to clear my head has been working great so far when I find myself struggling.


    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      - In the first instance, I will reach out to peers via discord help channels. If this is not successful then I will ask for help from homegroup facilitators. I could also escalate to the #help-requests channel.

    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
      - My expectation is to be treated fairly and equally, in an environment where creativity and communication is encouraged. Having a friendly facilitator is always a pleasant bonus :)
      - I would hope that the bootcamp is just the beginning of a collaborative relationship with facilitators, it seems there is a good culture within DA and a lot of students becoming facilitators etc.

    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
      - Not scheduling as such, but I have learned that I am most productive at night, so I usually do most of my work during the evenings / overnight. I will obviously change my schedule once we start the bootcamp.


Values and Identity

    Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.
    Regarding values, over the years, I have observed that colleagues I look up to, or successful people I aspire to be like, all display high levels of integrity, honesty, and diligence.
    I feel like values are something that require a long term commitment too, so I try my best to align to these in both my personal and professional life.
    
    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
    Unfortunately I found myself in a situation where my dog Roman got very sick in a short amount of time, with cancer of his spleen, something that could have been attempted to be treated, however, I was advised by multiple vets that the chances of success were slim, and that Roman's quality of life would be terrible. This left me in the situation where I had to weigh up my personal desire to do everything possible to make him better, perhaps for the selfish reason of wanting to keep him in my life; vs the decision to put him to sleep before he had to suffer any further. I had to make the decision to mitigate whatever pain I could for him, and this broke my heart, but was the right thing to do. I live with the consequences of this decision every day, the pain of not having him around still hurts even years later, but I also believe that there are more important things than my personal desire to keep him around, his comfort and quality of life being among them.


    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
      I was raised in a traditional Fijian-Indian home, even though I grew up here in NZ. This was often a confusing time as my sister and I were the only Indians in my primary school, and there was a definite culture shock in my younger years. From a young age, I was always taught that morals and values were paramount to becoming a better person. We were taught that honesty is critical, and service to others is not something that should be steered away from. I believe this absolutely has shaped my identity and is why I place such importance in things such as integrity and honesty.


    Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
      I used this time to do a Myers-Briggs personality test, something I had completed approx 15 years ago also. It was interesting to note that my resulting type has changed from previously.
      My result was ISTP-T and I found the descriptors to be quite fair and accurate. Some of the strengths identified were being hands-on, creative and rational. 

      In my previous role we were given the opportunity to work through the CliftonStrengths psychometric instrument. My top 5 strengths are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Relator</li>
          <li>Strategic</li>
          <li>Ideation</li>
          <li>Command</li>
          <li>Analytical</li>
        </ul>

      In terms of limitations - I definitely need to work on my focus, as it pertains to keeping to my time constraints and also not veering away from the core content I am working through.

    Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
      I am at times doggedly persistant when it comes to something I want to achieve. This can come with the associated cost of self-criticism when I do not meet the standards I aspire towards, so is a bit of a two-way sword. I have always used this determination to help further my career, whether that is learning associated systems or processes, or even simply in the amount of time invested into the role.
      
      I believe that my strengths will help me in my journey into development, as they intersect both the human and machine element of programming.

    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
      I feel my analytical nature will be helpful when looking at code blocks or debugging. Also, I feel like the ability to look at smaller chunks of code as part of a larger program will be something that I learn to get comfortable with fairly quickly. 

    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
    I have often come into conflict situations with my previous work, as managing expectations of different retailers across the country can get challenging. I used a system that kept customers across expected marketing promotions and individual expectations from each of the retailers. This could often be a difficult process as everybody has their own targets to achieve. My strategies were always to keep consistent communication, be honest about our requirements out of each promotion, and be willing to be flexible in some areas if that meant the relationship was better off for it. I believe the strategies were effective, however it helped that being a higher market share position in the market meant we could dictate terms at times. With reflection, I believe this was dealt with appropriately for the situation.
