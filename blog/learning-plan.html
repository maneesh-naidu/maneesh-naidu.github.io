      <h1>Learning Plan</h1>

      <p>What is your long term goal or career pathway?
        <ul>
          <li>I would like to look at junior developer roles as a natural outcome of successfully completing this bootcamp, with the intention of working towards a senior developer role within 3-5 years. In terms of goals, one of my key drivers is getting into a position where I am able to work remotely which would hopefully give me the balance needed to pursue my personal motorsport goals.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning:
        <ul>
          <li>I believe that my analytical nature will serve me well with regards to coding. I am good at looking at working examples and being able to assimilate that information. I am a natural problem solver, and try and be creative with solutions.</li> 
          <li>In terms of limitations, I definitely need to put work into my time management. I also feel like I can be too critical of my work, and this can also be a time sink.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        <ul>
          <li>I would like to use the group learning environment to develop my active listening skills, as well as work on my presentation skills in a technical capacity.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
  
      <p>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:
        <ul>
          <li>My intention is to keep regular cadence with my study sessions with a focus on multiple shorter sessions with breaks, I have found this works well for me in terms of content retention.</li>
          <li>My commitment to myself has been to invest no less than 40 hours per week into studies or coding practice</li>
          <li>I will treat other students and facilitators and affiliates with respect and honesty, which I hope fosters the same in return.</li>
          <li>When I run into issues, I will reach out to my homegroup facilitators and peers for help / support. I am also lucky to have the support of a friend who has been a great "rubber ducky" to date.</li>
          <li>I will also be making a conscious effort to take a step away from my desk when I feel overwhelmed or frustrated. Taking even a few minutes to clear my head has been working great so far when I find myself struggling.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way:
        <ul>
          <li>In the first instance, I will reach out to peers via discord help channels. If this is not successful then I will ask for help from homegroup facilitators. I could also escalate to the #help-requests channel.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
        <ul>
          <li>My expectation is to be treated fairly and equally, in an environment where creativity and communication is encouraged. Having a friendly facilitator is always a pleasant bonus :)</li>
          <li>I would hope that the bootcamp is just the beginning of a collaborative relationship with facilitators, it seems there is a good culture within DA and a lot of students becoming facilitators etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
        <ul>
          <li>Not scheduling as such, but I have learned that I am most productive at night, so I usually do most of my work during the evenings / overnight. I will obviously change my schedule once we start the bootcamp.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
