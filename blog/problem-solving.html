      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <p>
        This blog post is intended to show our strengthened understanding of, and approach to problem solving, as part of our week 4 sprint challenge.

      <h3>Being blocked by a simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        While initially starting this induction course, I found it very hard to remember the correct syntax of different operations, throw into this the fact we were learning 3 diferent languages at the same time and I often felt completely lost when trying to recall even the simplest task's, such as setting the language in the header portion of this page. There was a time when I was being stubborn when I couldn't recall this, and refused to allow myself to use problem-solving techniques such as google or our course documentation etc. I also have a friend I chat with in discord whom I use as a pseudo rubber ducky, and I also asked him not to assist with this. Being this restrictive on myself left me feeling extremely frustrated and negative towards my capabilities. I did eventually remember what needed to be done, but, the preceding 30 mins or so of frustration was an extremely good reminder of how important it is to use all available resources available to me and to think of them as tools to assist my growth mindset.

      <h3>Elegantly solving a problem</h3>
      <p>
        During this week's technical challenges, we were tasked with a set of JS "kata" excercises, which are intended to increased your mastery of particular tasks by practicing them routinely. I remember feeling quite daunted as I started the challenge, but found myself settling into the task and really enjoying how challenging the tasks were. I utilised a lot of google, particularly w3schools and MDN to help me understand how particular methods(essentially in-built functions within JS) worked and how they should be formatted. I also watched a couple of YouTube video's when I was feeling particularly lost, and spoke to a peer who has been helping me out with advice.

        My "AH-HA" moment came when doing the DeBee challenge, something I was slightly concerned about based on the comments I was seeing within our discord channel! However, after looking at the problem and re-reading it, I was able to immediately come up with a process that I thought was logical to achieve the end result. I then used Pseudo-code to write this process out, as I wasn't 100% sure about the syntax of everything. I was feeling pretty good about the problem after being able to break it down and list out what I wanted to do at each step of the way. I ended up confirming the correct syntax (which I mostly had correct) and compiling my solution with little trouble. The best part is that the solution worked first time, and it worked in the way that I had imagined it from the start. Throughout this process I felt empowered, because it was the solutions used in the previous exercises that were the little functions needed to make this solution work, so even typing out the beginning syntax felt familiar and comfortable. This whole process really reinforced the importance of repetition and practice of smaller functions and challenges. Our facilitator also introduced us to another couple of websites that allow this sort of practice, something that I am really looking forward to getting into in the coming weeks (or as time allows!)

      <h3>Problem Solving Techniques / Processes</h3>
      <p>
        The following is a list of some of the commonly used problem solving techniques and how I feel about each.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pseudocode - </strong>This is something I felt really comfortable with, my brain seemed to appreciate the process of breaking things down into manageable steps which I then used to find the correct methods to make my steps work. I will be using this a lot moving forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Trying something - </strong>I am comfortable just trying an idea out to see what errors or if it works, however I would likely do this after a few of the other processes listed here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Rubber Ducky method - </strong>One of my personal favourites. Cannot begin the count the amount of times I have tried to explain a problem to someone/something and the solution I was thinking of comes to mind. Shows the power of the mind!! Will also be used regularly moving forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reading error messages - </strong>Initially this was a difficult one for me, as there can often be a lot of information shown in an error message, but as I read more of them and looked at what the expected outcomes were on some of the tests, they began to make more sense to me, and I can absolutely see the value in them. This is something I intend to work on in the future as I believe it could become a key process for me.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Console.logging - </strong>This is something that I did not utilise as much as the other processes, not because I do not believe in the use of it, but more because I would usually have come to a solution before trying this option. I think I need to invest more time into getting comfortable with this option.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Googling - </strong>Probably the first step for me after I pseudocode what I want to do. In combination that seemed to be an extremely reliable process to follow. I can see that there is a lot of information out there, so some of the stack overflow topics went well above my head, but I'm confident that will be more comfortable as I increased my skill level.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Asking peers / coaches for help - </strong>This is something I did not do with cohorts for this weeks challenges, however I would have no issue doing as the need arose. In terms of coaches, I have a friend whom I bounce ideas off at times, and this absolutely helps me work through problems. 
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improving my process with reflection - </strong>This is something I think I innately do. I often spend time thinking back on why something worked in that days challenges, and I believe this can only help with retention of knowledge.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
