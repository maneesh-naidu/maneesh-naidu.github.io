      <h1>Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of this blog is to showcase some of the learnings from our week 4 core module on Neuroplasticity and the Growth mindset.
      </p>

      <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

      <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people:</h3>
      <p>
        The belief that your abilities are pre-determined or fixed can be highly detrimental to your motivation for self-improvement. If someone can embrace the knowledge that we all have the ability to grow our skillset simply by practicing and repeating processes or tasks, then it is easy to see the value in investing this time into self improvement. I believe that we all limit ourselves to some extent with personal doubts or fears, and as such, there is always potential for growth and learning.
      </p>

      <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit:</h3>
      <p>
        It is important to believe and understand that the time and effort you invest into learning a new skill or increasing your capabilities will be rewarded with growth. Personally, I have used this methodology to help alleviate apprehension when working through a project. I like to reference my automotive projects in this respect, as I have learned and implemented so much more than I would have thought possible a few years ago simply by focussing on the fact that any skill can be learnt and improved upon with enough determination and practice.
      </p>

      <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Stimulate your brain -</strong> Learn a new skill / language / instrument. Be creative with art, read a book. Play video games!! That's correct, research has shown that playing games for approx 16 hours (not at once!) can lead to improved neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Practice good sleep hygiene -</strong> Rest is an important factor in both physical and mental well-being, and research has shown that sleep plays an important role in promoting the right environment for neuroplasticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Excercise regularly -</strong> Research has shown that regular excercise is beneficial to your brain in multiple ways. A recent study has indicated that physical excercise can assist neuroplasticity via it's impact in stimulating growth of proteins that assist in nerve growth, as well as functional connectivity and support of the part of the brain that is responsible for motor control and learning.

      <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
      <img class="techexample" src="../images/growth-mindset.png" alt="A diagram showing the differences between fixed and growth mindsets">

      <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant:</h3>
      <p>
        Growth mindset can be summed up as follows (from Carol Dweck via HBR): "Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning." This is particularly relevant for me as I embark on this journey of learning new skills with Dev Academy and is something I need to reflect back on when I feel frustrated or negative.
      </p>
      
      <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
      <p>
        I wouldn't say that I was surprised, this concept is something I was introduced to through some personal development courses I have taken in my career. It was really good to revisit these learnings as it has been a while for me, and my belief in this concept is probably stronger now than it was in the past.
      </p>

      <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
      <p>
        I will endeavour to keep an open mind when it comes to problems that seem insurmountable, and will make a conscious effort to be aware of the value that I am getting simply by pushing myself and expanding my skillset. I have made a note to come back to some of the resources I have found, and hope that I can incorporate time into bootcamp for some reflection on this content.
