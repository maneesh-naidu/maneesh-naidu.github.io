      <h1>Identity and Values</h1>

      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
      <p>
        Regarding values, over the years, I have observed that colleagues I look up to, or successful people I aspire to be like, all display high levels of integrity, honesty, and diligence.
        I feel like values are something that require a long term commitment too, so I try my best to align to these in both my personal and professional life.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.</h3>
      <p>
        Unfortunately I found myself in a situation where my dog Roman got very sick in a short amount of time, with cancer of his spleen, something that could have been attempted to be treated, however, I was advised by multiple vets that the chances of success were slim, and that Roman's quality of life would be terrible. This left me in the situation where I had to weigh up my personal desire to do everything possible to make him better, perhaps for the selfish reason of wanting to keep him in my life; vs the decision to put him to sleep before he had to suffer any further. I had to make the decision to mitigate whatever pain I could for him, and this broke my heart, but was the right thing to do. I live with the consequences of this decision every day, the pain of not having him around still hurts even years later, but I also believe that there are more important things than my personal desire to keep him around, his comfort and quality of life being among them.
      </p>

      <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
      <p>
        I was raised in a traditional Fijian-Indian home, even though I grew up here in NZ. This was often a confusing time as my sister and I were the only Indians in my primary school, and there was a definite culture shock in my younger years. From a young age, I was always taught that morals and values were paramount to becoming a better person. We were taught that honesty is critical, and service to others is not something that should be steered away from. I believe this absolutely has shaped my identity and is why I place such importance in things such as integrity and honesty.
      </p>

      <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
      <p>
        I used this time to do a Myers-Briggs personality test, something I had completed approx 15 years ago also. It was interesting to note that my resulting type has changed from previously.
        My result was ISTP-T and I found the descriptors to be quite fair and accurate. Some of the strengths identified were being hands-on, creative and rational. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my previous role we were given the opportunity to work through the CliftonStrengths psychometric instrument. My top 5 strengths are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Relator</li>
          <li>Strategic</li>
          <li>Ideation</li>
          <li>Command</li>
          <li>Analytical</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of limitations - I definitely need to work on my focus, as it pertains to keeping to my time constraints and also not veering away from the core content I am working through.
      </p>
      <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
      <p>
        I am at times doggedly persistant when it comes to something I want to achieve. This can come with the associated cost of self-criticism when I do not meet the standards I aspire towards, so is a bit of a two-way sword. I have always used this determination to help further my career, whether that is learning associated systems or processes, or even simply in the amount of time invested into the role.
      
        I believe that my strengths will help me in my journey into development, as they intersect both the human and machine element of programming.
      </p>

      <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
      <p>
        I feel my analytical nature will be helpful when looking at code blocks or debugging. Also, I feel like the ability to look at smaller chunks of code as part of a larger program will be something that I learn to get comfortable with fairly quickly. 
      </p>
      <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
      <p>
      I have often come into conflict situations with my previous work, as managing expectations of different retailers across the country can get challenging. I used a system that kept customers across expected marketing promotions and individual expectations from each of the retailers. This could often be a difficult process as everybody has their own targets to achieve. My strategies were always to keep consistent communication, be honest about our requirements out of each promotion, and be willing to be flexible in some areas if that meant the relationship was better off for it. I believe the strategies were effective, however it helped that being a higher market share position in the market meant we could dictate terms at times. With reflection, I believe this was dealt with appropriately for the situation.
